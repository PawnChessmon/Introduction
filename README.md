## 🧬 Profile  

I'm a **bioinformatician** with a classical biology background and strong focus on computational biology. My expertise spans **R, Python**, and **high-throughput data analysis**, with special interest in **spatial transcriptomics**, **multi-omics integration**, and **bioinformatics pipeline automation**.

Currently, I work as a **Demonstrator at the University of Glasgow**, supporting MSc and PhD students with bioinformatics workflows, omics analysis, and statistical modelling. My research contributes to cancer genomics, microbial genomics, and data infrastructure for high-throughput submissions (e.g., ENA).  

I’m passionate about inclusive, interdisciplinary science and thrive in collaborative environments where computational methods solve real biological problems.
