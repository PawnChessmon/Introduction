# Introduction

👋 Hi, I'm Ritupam Sarma

Bioinformatician | Spatial Transcriptomics Researcher | Teaching Assistant
📍 Glasgow, UK | 🌈 LGBT+ in STEM | 🧬 Passionate about computational biology in cancer research and infectious diseases.

I’m a bioinformatician with a strong foundation in R, Python, and UNIX/Linux systems, and a deep interest in solving complex biological problems through data. I currently work as a demonstrator at the University of Glasgow, where I support MSc and PhD students in developing key skills in computational biology, omics analysis, and statistical modelling.

🔬 Current Research Focus
My ongoing work centres on spatial transcriptomics in cancer, using 10x Visium and Seurat to decode how gene expression patterns change across tumour microenvironments. I’m investigating:
Stress-induced changes in lung cancer (in collaboration with the CRUK Scotland Institute and the Medical University of Vienna)
Colorectal cancer-derived lung metastasis, integrating spatial data and clinical metadata
Biomarker discovery in tumour tissues for precision oncology, using clustering, dimensionality reduction, and cell-type annotation

🧰 Technical Skills
Programming: R, Python, Bash, SQL
Bioinformatics Tools: Seurat, PyMOL, MetaboAnalyst, BLASTn, VEP, IGV
Genomics: RNA-seq (bulk + scRNA-seq), WGS, GWAS, variant annotation
Data Engineering: Metadata handling, database design (SQLite), ENA pipeline automation
HPC/Workflow: Job scheduling (qsub), symbolic linking, data QC & trimming
Visualisation: PCA, volcano plots, heatmaps, molecular renderings

🔧 Recent Projects
⚙️ ENA Automation Tool: A command-line solution for streamlined ENA submissions, developed for shared facilities and PI support at the University of Glasgow.
🧪 Multi-Omics Analysis in Leishmania: Polyomics project integrating WGS, metabolomics, and protein modelling to study Amphotericin B resistance.
🧠 Malaria Pathogenesis: MSc project using network mapping to study Plasmodium falciparum VSAs (rifin/stevor genes).

🎓 Education & Mentoring
