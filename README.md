# Hi, I'm Ritupam Sarma 👋

I am a Bioinformatician and Demonstrator at the University of Glasgow with expertise in cancer genomics, infection biology, and computational genomics. I specialize in analyzing complex multi-omic datasets, including cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics, to uncover biological insights in cancer and infectious diseases.

## About Me

Learn more about my background, skills, and research on my [Online Portfolio](https://pawnchessmon.github.io/Introduction/).

- Proficient in NGS data analysis, variant filtering, and multi-omics integration using R, Python, and UNIX/Linux environments.
- Skilled in developing robust bioinformatics pipelines with Nextflow and managing HPC workflows.
- Experienced in spatial transcriptomics platforms such as 10x Genomics Visium, CosMx, and GeoMx DSP.
- Passionate about applying computational biology techniques to understand cancer progression, pathogen biology, and host–pathogen interactions.
- Interested in machine learning and deep learning applications in bioinformatics using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Technical Skills

- **Genomics & Transcriptomics:** RNA-seq (bulk & single-cell), WGS, GWAS, variant annotation, spatial transcriptomics
- **Programming & Tools:** R (Seurat, DESeq2), Python (scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Git, Nextflow, UNIX/Linux
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** ggplot2, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PCA, heatmaps, spatial feature plots
